- Express


## Frontend 
- Typescript via npm
TypeScript is available as a package on the npm registry available as "typescript".
You will need a copy of Node.js as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like npm, yarn or pnpm to download TypeScript into your project.
```
npm install typescript --save-dev
```
All of these dependency managers support lockfiles, ensuring that everyone on your team is using the same version of the language. You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:
```
npx tsc
```
By default the TypeScript compiler will print a help message when run in an empty project. The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file. You can have TypeScript create tsconfig.json with the recommended settings with:
```
npx tsc --init
```
